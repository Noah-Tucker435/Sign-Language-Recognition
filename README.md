# Sign-Language-Recognition
A Machine Learning project that can recognize sign language.
1. In order to use this you will need to create a train and test folder within your file directory.
2. Ideally create the train and test folder as close to the project code as possible.
3. When it comes to saving and loading the model, you will need to specify your own locations to load and save the project, mine are just there for example.


There are roughly a million examples of this online and as such this project is mainly intended only for personal/educational purposes and as such you shouldn't utilize this code.
